## Notes application

Application which allows you to manage your notes. In this application you can **display** notes from database, **add** new notes, **delete** and **edit** note from and in the database. You can also **search** any notes by their title and display their content in the **markdown** format.

To built this application I use:

* JavaScript (ES6)
* AXIOS (to fetch the notes from the databes)
* Bootstrap (application view)
* Routing (to control display content)
* Showdown (markdown to HTML converter) 

## Installation & Run.

To **start** the application **run** the commands below:

Run your IDE and start new terminal (in VSC shortcut CTRL+Shift+')
In new open terminal run the command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Jacek91/notesApplication.git
$ npm install
$ npm run start-api (to run the database with notes based on JSON Server)
Start new (second) terminal (to run the application)
$ npm start
Start your browser and open the following address **http://localhost:7000/**
```
